**What it means to perform full testing of a website**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a professional background as a Quality Assurance Engineer on web-based platforms. Quality Assurance is a profession whos goal is to assure that the end product is of the highest quality possible. What this means in practice is to spend time testing applications and surfacing bugs and issues to developers so issues get fixed before releasing the product.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of different types or sub-categories of testing that are contained within the responsibilities of a Quality Assurance Engineer. Some examples are: black-box testing, responsive testing, cross-browser testing, performance testing, accessibility testing, regression testing, security testing and others. I will only touch on some of the more important ones here. 

**Black-box Testing**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When starting out testing a new website, it is best to approach it from the mindset of an end user of the website. Take things slowly and deliberately. The website acts as a black box that you do not know the inner workings of. All you have is the output that is visible on screen. Make note of how the navigation works (is it intuitive, are there any hidden or dead-end pages). Make note of how content is arranged on the page (do sections logically flow into each other). Make note of any buttons or dynamic content sections (are buttons behaving consistently. Does dynamic content load into the page correctly). Make note of the images and text on each page (do images show up clearly with correct proportions. Is all text readable). Approaching testing in the way helps to find issues that normally would be overlooked.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For larger and more detailed websites or web applications, create a "happy path" workflow. The "happy path" is the most logical navigation or page routing that users will go through. Ensuring that the most commonly used features are working correctly is more important than testing for edge case scenarios.

**Testing Responsiveness**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive web design is a pivotal part of having a modern website. Users who visit the site will be using a wide variety of devices and screen sizes. Having a responsive design allows for the website to look good and be consistent across any of the devices that it might be viewed on. The best way to test for responsive design is to use a wide variety of physical devices to access the website. An alternative to having to have lots of different devices is to simulate them. Device emulators are available online often for free. Android emulators are commonly used during development of mobile applications. While emulators can come close to how an actual device works, there are still differences and testing on an actual device is preferred.

**Cross-browser testing**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different users prefer using different browsers when accessing the Internet. You cannot only perform testing on your preferred browser and expect things to work the same for all other users. Different browsers behave differently in subtle ways that may effect how the website is displayed. 

**Accessibility Testing**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessibility refers to the ability to navigate and use a website by persons with disabilities. ADA (American Disability Act) applies to online businesses

**Performance testing**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance testing refers to how a website functions

**Google Lighthouse as a testing metric**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Google Lighthouse is a built-in browser tool available for Chromium based browsers that will audit the quality and performance of a web page and return a report and some advice on how to improve best practices. The Lighthouse tool can be a quick way to understand the basic structure of a web page.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a few downsides to the tool. Firstly, it only runs on a single web page at a time. It is not a comprehensive audit of an entire website. Most of the time Lighthouse will be run on the landing page of a website since that is the most important page to make a good first impression with users. Secondly, Lighthouse is not incredibly accurate. Running the tool back to back on the same web page will often return slightly different metric numbers. It is important to take the results with a grain of salt and not get caught up on specific numbers. It is only meant to give a quick general perspective on how a web page is performing. Thirdly, the improvement suggestions are not always correct or a good idea to implement.
