Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The different is in the **when** it generates the HTML for the page.

-   **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that genrates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
-   **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

Random code snippet
`code`
export default function Error({ error, reset }: { error: Error & { digest?: string }; reset: () => void }) {
useEffect(() => {
// Log the error to an error reporting service
console.error(error)
}, [error])

    return (
    	<div>
    		<h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
    		<button
    			onClick={
    				// Attempt to recover by trying to re-render the segment
    				() => reset()
    			}
    		>
    			Try again
    		</button>
    		<p>
    			Or go back to <Link href="/">Home page</Link>
    		</p>
    	</div>
    )

}
`code`
