**Email templates and signatures created through HTML**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email signatures are the little snippet that shows up at the bottom of emails. Typically it show personal or business information 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing email signatures is trickier than it sounds. Emails and websites are similar in that they are both structured around HTML code. 

1. Using an HTML editor designed to work for email signatures
2. Generating your email signature.
3. Designing your email signature from scratch in HTML. It is time consuming and hard, but you can base your code on a working email signature template.
4. Using an email signature editor built into your email client, each one is different and comes with a custom experience, but in general they usually can get the job done.

**Wrong ways to design your email signature**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating email signatures in Microsoft Word. You would not believe how much strange invisible formatting you get when designing an email signature in a word processor. This invisible formatting usually works for Outlook for Windows, but right after an email leaves your mailbox, it usually gets mangled.
Using graphic design tools. I mean it is a good starting point but getting from here to a working HTML code is a long way. Automatically converting the design to HTML just does not work and using an image-only email signature has a lot of downsides, especially for mobile email signatures.
