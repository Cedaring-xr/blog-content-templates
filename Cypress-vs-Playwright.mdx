**Intro into modern web app testing**

Modern testing frameworks handle testing in a more comprehensive way, and mirror the more modern development frameworks that they are testing for. The older alternative is to use a separated process that is independant of the language and methodologies of development. In practicality this means using Selenium with your language of choice to independently perform the testing on an application. While this allows for more overall flexibility, in my opinion completely separating the testing process and the development process is a uneccesary practice, and leads to a greater team separation and lack of knowledge transfer and communication. The end result is an overall decrease in quality and an increase in time spent between release cycles.

**Cypress.io**

Cypress is a very expansive testing framework that can be used a little or a lot depending on your needs. Most people view Cypress as an end-to-end testing framework, but it can also handle integration level tests very well and is also capable of handling unit testing. I have spend several years working though the different use cases of Cypress, and found it very enjoyable to work with.

**Playwright**

Playwright is a powerful testing tool that pairs very well with React based applications.

**Large shift in testing mindset**

Having a separated team structure, skillset, and mindset between testers and development leads to an overall decrease in quality over time. I have met a handful of developers that have a poor opinion of testers for many reasons. I have also met many testers that have a severe lack of knowledge around how to develop and build application. I believe that

If you have a development framework written in a certain language, then your testing framework should match that and be written in a similar manor.

**Closely pairing your testing with the main codebase**
